3. Then, select a project (if you already have a project), create a project with the desired name, and then click create (if you don't have a project).
4. In the Explorer section, search "new_york_citibike" to find the dataset, here I use the dataset with the ID "bigquery-public-data.new_york_citibike" which has been provided by bigquery-public-data
5. The new_york_citibike dataset contains 2 tables, namely the "citibike_stations" and "citibike_trips" tables, in this project I focus on analyzing by querying the "citibike_trips" table.
6. Then, after performing SQL queries, do exploration using Google Data Studio to facilitate data analysis with visualization by clicking "EXPLORE DATA" -> "Explore with Data Studio"
